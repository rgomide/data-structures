# Linked lists

This project is covering the List data structure.

## Linked list classification

A list can be classified according to navigation pointers:

- Singly linked
- Doubly linked

We also classify a linked list by sorting the element during the insertion actions:

- Unsorted list
- Sorted list

Finally, we have the `Circular` linked list classification. In this kind of list the last element points to first when it is singly linked. In doubly linked lists the last element points to first and the first element points to last.

## Implementation

Check the [UnsortedSinglyLinkedList](./src/main/java/br/com/gomide/list/singly/UnsortedSinglyLinkedList.java) class and [UnsortedSinglyLinkedListTest](./src/test/java/br/com/gomide/list/singly/UnsortedSinglyLinkedListTest.java) test to clarify the concepts and implementation.
